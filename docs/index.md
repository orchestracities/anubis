# Welcome to Anubis!

Anubis is a flexible Policy Enforcement solution that makes easier to reuse
security policies across different services, assuming the policies entail the
same resource.

Let's think of a user that register some data in platform A.
To control who can access his data he develops a set of policies.
If he move the data to platform B, most probably he will have to define again
the control access policies for that data also in platform B.

Anubis aims to avoid that :) or at least simplify this as much as possible
for the data owner.

Github's [README.md](https://github.com/orchestracities/anubis/blob/master/README.md)
provides a good documentation summary.
The [User Manual](user/index.md) and the [Admin Guide](admin/index.md)
cover more advanced topics.
