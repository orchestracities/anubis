# Default policies

A set of policies can also be set up to be created upon the creation of a Tenant through a file.
See [this provided example](config/opa-service/default-policies.yml). 
The path to this file can be set using the
`DEFAULT_POLICIES_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

See [Policies](../user/policies) for defining them.
